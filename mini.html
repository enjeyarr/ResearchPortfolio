            <div class="row">
                <div class="medium-6 columns">
                  <p>We had two months to deeply investigate how high schoolers (and their influencing adults) plan their futures. While keeping an eye out for high-demand career selection, we were inductively looking to see what needs and problems arose.</p>
                  <p>This was a very collaborative process with the entire team participating in all project stages. As Research Lead, I owned the research plan, authored most protocols, and led synthesis activities.</p>

                <div class="medium-5 columns">
                  <p>Our project scope was extremely broad, which was a blessing and a curse. We just had to make something that helped students plan careers while addressing the high-demand workforce. We had the time to inductively discover specific needs and how these two agendas might intersect.</p>
<!--                  <p>Career planning proved a difficult research topic. It’s hard to observe and continuous over a person’s lifetime. Everyone goes through it, so we had to look across geography, class, and ethnicity. And getting access to students in contextual settings is difficult.</p>-->
           <!--        <p>The preliminary research goals were to:</p>
                  <ul>
                      <li>Broadly discover the career planning needs of students and their supporting adults</li>

                <div class="medium-5 columns">
                <p>Our first research project was to get familiar with the ecosystem of career planning in middle and high school. In a literature review we looked at education policy, career social psychology, and multi-cultural considerations that reflect Pittsburghs' demographics.</p>
                <p>Remote interviews were then a quick and cost-effective way to probe a wide variety of first-hand experiences. We did 15 interviews across guidance counselors, parents, teachers, policy experts, non-profits, and students. Our topics included behavior related to career planning and advising, especially pain points and obstacles people faced.</p>

                <div class="medium-5 columns">
                  <p>Realizing that early high school students were our most promising target for an intervention, we needed a deeper dive into how a diverse array of high schoolers thought of their career futures and their challenges. We interviewed 12 more high schoolers, trying to get a mix of public and private schools in the city and more rural areas.</p>
                  <p>We were interested in a diversity of teens' internal experiences while planning career futures. Interviews probed on topics of their current career and post-high school plans, what in their past influenced them, interactions with adults/schools, and uncertainties they see in their future.</p>
                  <p>From these interviews, we clustered interview quotes into two levels of insights with an affinity diagram. Affinity diagraming helped the large research team synthesize takeaways and reach group understanding faster than a traditional coding process.</p>
