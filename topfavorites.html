              <h3>The Challenge</h3>
                <p class="summary-p">The COVID-19 pandemic changed commuting habits in the US, and Scoop carpooling was moving fast to <strong><span class="highlight">improve safety</span></strong> for essential and returning workers. Although normally matched via algorithm, PM suggested we look at a new feature allowing <strong><span class="highlight"> direct user-to-user matching, similar to COVID "bubbles".</span></strong></p>

              <h3>The Research</h3>
                <p class="summary-p"> Without normally allotted time for discovery, I efficiently vetted the design concept by dovetailing a seperate COVID-19 <strong><span class="highlight">survey project and reviewing past qual feedback channels.</span></strong><br><br> After the design phase, I then <strong><span class="highlight">user tested</span></strong> the "Top Favorites" solution at medium-high fidelity with diverse carpooler segments (n=8).</p>

              <h3>The Impact</h3>
                <p class="summary-p">User feedback strongly supported direct carpool matching as the <strong><span class="highlight">#1 safety feature</span></strong> not yet implemented. <br> <br> Usability testing identified <strong><span class="highlight">15 usability concerns</span></strong>, leading to design improvements to discoverability and request management.</p>

                        <p>During the early design phases of Top Favorites, I met with PM and the Designer to <strong><span class="highlight">determine if and at what stage we wanted to do evaluative testing.</span></strong>                   <br><br>
                            We determined that a <strong><span class="highlight">medium-high mockup</span></strong> was appropriate for testing. This was looking like one of the most complex interactions ever designed for the app, and so we wanted it to feel as “real” as possible given time constraints. We definitely wanted to see if users understood and could succesfully complete tasks. Enough time for revisions was built into Design timeline.

                    <div class="medium-6 columns">
                        <p>After the Designer walked me through the current design and any usability doubts she had, I articulated my plan for usability testing.
                        <br><br>
                        This plan was workshopped with Design while going through the prototype together and then agreed upon in a meeting with UXR, Design, and PM. We then worked on fleshing out some more detail screens and variations for the test, and Karen (Design) put together the Invision clickthrough.

                        <p>I sent the deck early so we could focus our readout meeting with Design and PM on <strong><span class="highlight">collaboratively resolving the largest usability issues.</span></strong>
                            <br><br>
                            Most usability resolutions were pretty quickly agreed upon. The issues with the most debate involved <strong><span class="highlight">two decisions about walking back previous alignments</span></strong> that therefore were not included in the usability test (including the C-suite weighing in).<br><br> I contributed my critiques based on usability heuristics, and reminded the team that the usability results were <strong><span class="highlight">not</span></strong> data points on these two particular topics. At the end of the day, PM determined the changes were worth the risk of untested design changes, and design progressed.

                        <p>Top Favorites was <strong><span class="highlight">launched in Nov 2020.</span></strong> Although my final days at Scoop were at the end of that month and I never received a full impact report, I know that at least some users were taking Top Favorite trips and I didn’t identify any issues in my qualitative listening channels.
                        <br><br>
                        Lessons learned:

                        - Push for greater organizational understanding and schedule for exploratory user research

                        - Get C-Suite buy-in before, and not after, the only slotted usability test
