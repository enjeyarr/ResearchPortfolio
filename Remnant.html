				<h1>Remnant RPG Case&nbsp;Study</h1>
				<p class="subtitle">Streamlining a tabletop RPG with a digital dashboard</p>
			<div class="main-text">
			<h2 >Overview</h2>
				<p>This side project is the design of a companion web app for my tabletop role-playing game, tentatively called "Remnant" (think Dungeons &amp; Dragons). The game centers on players collecting and battling with random magical items. We decided a companion web app would streamline the complex item and character management of this game and provide a dashboard to sync player knowledge across the group.</p>
			
			<p>From a business perspective, this would not only help gameplay itself become more viable and enjoyable, but it would generate website traffic and promotional press for our product. The early phases of the app design are foundational user research, feature brainstorming, and prototyping.</p>			
			
			<h2>Early Qualitative Research</h2>
				<p>Designing both the game and the companion app began with foundational research based on digital ethnography - online immersion into the culture and industry of Tabletop RPG’s. I immersed myself in online forums, message boards like Reddit, digital histories, and review sites for RPG’s, both mainstream and indie. </p> 
				<p> I am conducting semi-structured interviews with RPG players to get at how groups manage their characters (both on paper and virtual tabletops), how the materials affect the pace of gameplay, and attitudes on game design. These interviews have already inspired use cases such as dashboard features for party management after a player wished for a way to decentralize knowledge from the Game Master and the difficulty of tallying information on paper.</p>
		
				<h2>Competitive Research</h2>
				<p>The movement towards digital tabletop RPG solutions isn’t new, and is largely dominated by a few big industry names. Through a Competitive Analysis, we hoped to hone-in on their successful features we would not attempt to replicate, while evaluating gaps in the industry our app would fulfill.</p>
			
				<p>This analysis focused the app towards three main functions that we could do better: Character Stats, Group Status, and Item Management.</p>

			<h2>Personas</h2>
				<p>Based on my digital research and interviews, I created four personas as quick and condensed references for the range of potential users. I used Xtensio as a template and comparison tool.</p>

			<h2>User Stories</h2>
				<p>After the personas and competitive analysis guided me towards the essential app functions of item, character, and party management, I wrote generalized user stories of central tasks the app would perform. More complex and advanced feature user stories will be added, transfered to use cases, and help guide multiple iterations of the UI and data architecture.</p>
			<h2>Wireframing</h2>
				<p>Based on our three central app features, I did some design thinking sketch exercises on paper to brainstorm many rough wireframes.</p>
				<img src="remnant/LittleBrainstorm.jpg" class="wire" alt="Brainstormed wireframe sketches"><img src="remnant/BigBrainstorm.jpg" class="wire" alt="Refined wireframe sketches illustrating fluid dashboard">
				<p>I chose to go with a fluid dashboard design, where modules could laterally shift in and out as players focused on particular aspects of play, such as inventory or party management. I then made some low-fi wireframes in Adobe XD.</p>

			<h2>Next Steps</h2>
				<p>Our next steps are to create increasingly high-fidelity and iteratively tested wireframes and mockups as we add more advanced features and information architecture to the app. We also hope to begin contextual inquiries of play observation to see group interaction with reference materials and technology. Down the road, the goal is to start prototyping the web app with React and Firebase for snappy UI and database updates, while designing the game in parrallel.</p>
