				<h1>Stonewall Resource Center Ethnography</h1>
				<p class="subtitle">Investigating how students use LGBTQ resources and spaces</p>
				<div class="main-text">
				<h2>Objective</h2>

				<p>I conducted a four-month ethnography of Grinnell College’s LGBTQ Stonewall Resource Center (SRC) for my anthropological Ethnographic Research Methods class. My research goals were to investigate how students were using and imagining the physical space of the center, as well as the social dynamics of the affiliated students groups and LGBTQ students who chose not to engage with the center. I was also asked by SRC leadership to investigate why students weren't using the space to its full potential.</p>

				<h2>My Role</h2>

				<p>This was a solo project in which I conducted the research, created interview guides, drew from secondary theory, and presented results. Suggestions were made by my Methods professor, but I had pretty much complete control over the project. As an LGBTQ student who was only tangentially involved with the SRC, I was in a unique position to conduct this research as both an "insider" and an "outsider".</p>

				<h2>Methods</h2>

				<p>I conducted over 30 hours of participant observation at the Stonewall Resource Center and two affiliated groups, as well as 9 semi-structured interviews. The SRC is a physical center with a library, office, and large lounge area for hanging out and student groups. It is also a larger organizational "umbrella" for ten or so distinct student groups, from Lesbian Movie Night to the Trans Action Group.</p>

				<p>Participant observation is a core part of ethnography - both observing participants in a cultural context and participating in that context yourself. When purely observing, I jotted down shorthand when I could, and immediately afterwards wrote detailed field notes. When participating and writing notes was socially unacceptable, I wrote detailed field notes from memory afterwards. My time was split between open observation of the SRC center space, as well as regularly attending two LGBTQ student group meetings.</p>

				<p>I conducted 9 semi-structured interviews, with 11 total participants. I purposefully sampled from different student ages, group affiliation, and gender identities. Through “snowball” sampling, I gathered other potential interviewees by word of mouth, which was especially helpful for locating participants who required confidentiality and trust. If I were to extend the study, I would have tried to include more trans students and other leadership under the SRC organizational umbrella</p>

				<p>A final readout presentation was given to my Methods class, and a report was sent to the SRC leadership.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>

				<p>The results of this study are not publicly available due to ethical considerations of the college's IRB. More detail can be provided in confidential interviews. In my analysis, I addressed research questions with a cultural lens and theorized models for organization, student participation, and student aversion to the center. My insights involved the culture of the physical space, in-group/out-group conceptualizations between student groups, and conflicting framings of “the SRC” as both a monolithic group and a series of subgroups with varying levels of connectivity.</p>

				<h2>Takeaways</h2>

				<p>This project was my first serious foray into ethnographic methods. It was rewarding to academically investigate a topic close to own identity and experience, and challenged me to conceptualize other students’ experiences from multiple viewpoints. It also allowed me to present actionable recommendations to improve student experiences. Methodologically, it was ethically complex and occasionally intense, with information being highly confidential and involving student conflict over shared identities. Some interviewees declined participation over worries about questioning their identities. It challenged me to choose samples and methods that would best answer my questions in a limited time-frame, while providing enough robust qualitative data to formulate high level theory on organizational structure and social identities.</p>
