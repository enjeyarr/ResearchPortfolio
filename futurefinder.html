              <h3>The Challenge</h3>
              <p class="summary-p">Our clients came to us for a product or service that could educate high schoolers about high-demand careers in the Pittburgh Region’s future. We reframed the challenge around solving the needs of teens as they explore career directions, promoting both personal and regional growth.</p>
              <h3>The Research</h3>
              <p class="summary-p">Three months of exploratory research broadly investigated the career planning space in high school and beyond, leading to three areas of design opportunity.
              Research was then a continuous back-and-forth with design, including two rounds of user testing at very high fidelity.
              </p>

              <h3>The Impact</h3>
              <p class="summary-p">Two rounds of user testing strongly validated the prototyped app “FutureFinder” and met client goals. 40% of all “favorited” careers were in high demand in the Pittsburgh Region, with all target teens discovering new careers that matched interests.</p>

            <h4>BACKGROUND</h4>
            <h2>The Pittsburgh Region&rsquo;s Future &amp; Our Clients&rsquo; Vision</h2>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="medium-5 columns">
                  <p>Our client, Allegheny Conference, is a non-profit concerned with the Pittsburgh Region’s economic future and development. Through this initiative with Numo, they wanted to increase future high-demand employment by targeting high schoolers.</p>
                  <p>Allegheny Conference's research showed that the region would experience shortfalls in important career sectors if current trends continue (80,000 positions by 2025). They are working on multiple economic initiatives to address this. But in this project they approached the problem from the beginning. If students knew more about high-demand careers before making decisions like college, the region might create more in-demand talent.</p>
                  <p>Their initial vision was that data visualizations could help students make better decisions about what future local jobs would meet their financial goals. However, they wanted us to broadly explore and see if we came up with a similar or different solution.</p>
                  <p>We quickly realized data communication was not enough. Our design process had to place teens’ motivations first, with high-demand employment as a more subtle goal. This pivoted our research towards teens' needs and motivations for career planning.</p>

            <h2>Generative Research: Discovering Teens’ Needs</h2>
            <div class="row">
                <div class="medium-6 columns">
                  <p>We had two months to deeply investigate how high schoolers (and their influencing adults) plan their futures. While keeping an eye out for high-demand career selection, we were inductively looking to see what needs and problems arose.</p>
                  <p>This was a very collaborative process with the entire team participating in all project stages. As Research Lead, I owned the research plan, authored most scripts, and led synthesis activities.</p>

                <div class="medium-5 columns">
                  <p>Our project scope was extremely broad, which was a blessing and a curse. We just had to make something that helped students plan careers while addressing the high-demand workforce. We had the time to inductively discover specific needs and how these two agendas might intersect.</p>
<!--                  <p>Career planning proved a difficult research topic. It’s hard to observe and continuous over a person’s lifetime. Everyone goes through it, so we had to look across geography, class, and ethnicity. And getting access to students in contextual settings is difficult.</p>-->
                  <p>The preliminary research goals were to: broadly discover the career planning needs of students and their supporting adults, which students to target, and the best methods or people to help them make change (perhaps guidance counselors, parents?).</p>

                <div class="medium-5 columns">
                  <p>Realizing that early high school students were our most promising target for an intervention, we needed a deeper dive into how a diverse array of high schoolers thought of their career futures and their challenges.</p>
                    <p>We interviewed 12 more high schoolers, trying to get a mix of public and private schools in the city and more rural areas. Most were remote semi-structured interviews with some in-person.</p>
                  <p>We were interested in a diversity of internal experiences while planning for teens’ futures. Interviews probed on topics of their current career and post-high school plans, what in their past influenced them, interactions with adults/schools, and uncertainties they see in their future.</p>
                  <p>From these interviews, we gathered interview quotes and created an affinity diagram grouping into two levels of insights. Affinity diagraming helped the large research team synthesize takeaways and reach group understanding faster than a traditional coding process.</p>

            <div class="row">
                <div class="medium-5 columns">
                  <p>After spending so much time with students, a teammate and I realized we needed to speak with adults who had actually gone through career journeys. What worked for them? What didn’t? We interviewed eight Pittsburgh-area adults (half in high-demand careers), taking notes in journey format for speedy synthesis</p>
                    <p>The journeys were boiled down to about three patterns of job exploration. Those who found careers early (often through a formative experience), those that pivoted multiple times, and those that had not found it yet. Users who found well-matched careers described it as an “Ah-Hah” moment.</p>
                  <p>For those that had not found satisfying careers, many felt “trapped” by mounting responsibilities as pivoting or going back to school became difficult.</p>
                  <p>Of course high schoolers can’t predict their future careers, almost everyone pivots and explores. But by redirecting earlier towards interests, they can more easily pivot before it becomes costly.</p>

                <div class="medium-5 columns">
                  <p>Hoping to gain more context on Pittsburgh area high schoolers in person, we worked on getting into a high school for about two months.</p>
                    <p>We finally partnered with Elizabeth Forward High School, in a somewhat rural suburb. We negotiated working with four classrooms of early high schoolers, as well as a downtime to do contextual inquiries with teachers and guidance counselors.</p>
                    <p>To make the most of the 60+ students we were working with, we turned to codesign workshop activities. The first workshop in each group was research-oriented, quickly gathering info about student goals, planning behavior, and influences. The second workshop brought teens together to collaborate on solutions to career planning problems, using  provided materials. We wanted to see what teens felt was difficult and what solutions they were drawn to.</p>
                  <p>These workshops accomplished multiple things: gaining school context, gathering a wider sample of career prep behavior, and seeing what solutions teens created themselves. For more info on workshop design, you can read my Medium post about our school visit!</p>

                  <p>After each effort in our Exploratory Research, we had grouped insights and found main takeaways. As our big transition to design, we “walked the wall” and did a final pass reviewing all of our qualitative research together. The goal was to find connections and design opportunities across research projects.</p>
                    <p>The group took personal notes and wrote down stickies of the biggest challenges and design opportunities we observed, layering over the physical insights and models we had previously created.</p>
                    <p>We then organized and sorted these notes into our group’s observed challenges and opportunities.</p>

                <div class="medium-5 columns">
                  <p>After weeks of design exercises and sprints, the team decided to do early concepting research with teens and parents.</p>
                    <p>The purpose was not to tell us precicely “which design was best,” but rather which needs and avenues our potential users gravitated towards. These high-level concepts hopefully would start conversations about what people would and wouldn’t do in future situations.</p>
                    <p>COMBINE WITH PREVIOUS P   Four storyboards of our top initial ideas were created, keeping concepts high level but allowing people to imagine the steps involved. Through “speed dating” we showed them to students and parents, sparking conversation and probing boundaries.</p>

                <div class="medium-5 columns">
                    <p>An important aspect of design research is sometimes investigating what your internal stakeholders believe and gravitate towards (with a grain of salt of course). Allegheny Conference had experts in economic development while numo had experts in interaction design.</p>
                    <p>We picked their brains through the codesign activity “Business Origami” from Bruce Hanington’s 100 Methods of Design. After small group brainstorming around design opportunities, they then brought ideas to life with cutouts of people, places, and devices. This forces design ideas to be dynamic and take into account social complexities of implementation.</p>
                    <p>This workshop not only helped provide one of our final design ideas, but gave us an understanding of sometimes conflicting client visions of the problems and what types of solutions they were willing to support.</p>

                <div class="medium-5 columns">
                  <p>After more weeks of design, we settled on three different ideas with very different implementation: a summer job rotation program, a structured game, and a platform for open exploration. Each met our two goals of increaseing career exposure and providing first-hand information at various scales.</p>
                    <p>We A/B/C tested these concepts with teens, parents, and teachers. Storyboarding wasn’t a high enough fidelity for students/parents to understand their usage. Through click-through prototypes in InVIsion, we gave our potential users a hands-on view of what the products/services would feel like.</p>

                <div class="medium-5 columns">
                  <p>From our workshops and interviewed, we had created Archetypes to capture segments of teen career planning behavior. These established a common language in the design team to talk about behavior. But as we went on, we found too many "exceptions" in concepting research. Although we didn’t feel the segmentation was “wrong,” it didn’t capture variables that were now relevant to our solutions and needs fulfillment. It felt too simple.</p>
                  <p>Another researcher and I went back into our qualitative data (more than 40 interviews and concept tests) with the lens of which variables we thought were actually mattering in career planning behavior (such as how open they were to exploring other options, age, and parent behavior).</p>
                  <p>We emerged with three new Personas, this time more nuanced and in stronger relation to our design work. This allowed us to balance needs and features in our core design and future roadmaps.</p>

                    <p>We did our first user test at a CMU summer camp (an efficient way to get high schoolers during the summer).</p>
                    <p>At this point, we had our final design but were still tweaking things. We actually A/B tested two different versions of the app. We varied the framing of the app - in one disguising the purpose of the app as simply "self-discovery" rather than careers. The number of questions and results were also varied. Finally, we tested three versions of the job cards themselves, which design couldn’t agree upon.</p>
                    <p>A card sort was done to rank students’ interest in job-related information. We wanted to see what info was important to teens to better design the job data vizualizations.</p>

                  <p>With only a week left, we didn’t have time to make huge usability changes. Although we conducted think-aloud usability testing, we were mainly testing how successful it was in its current design.</p>
                    <p>Our major sucess metrics were:
                    <ul>
                      <li>Are students discovering new careers that interest them?</li>
                      <li>Are they favoritiing jobs?</li>
                      <li>What proportion are high-demand future careers?</li>
                      <li>Are students interested and/or motivated to use the app?</li>
                  </ul>

                    <p>I pushed for testing at very high fidelity with a working backend. The prototypes needed to feel as real as possible, to see if teens were actually discovering new careers relevant to their interests. We spent a lot of time mocking up over 50 careers, a personality quiz, and a mock machine learning algorithm.</p>
