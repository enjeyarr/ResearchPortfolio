              <h3>The Challenge</h3>
              <p class="summary-p">
                  As a fast-moving startup, Scoop had more qualitative feedback (like support tickets and NPS responses) than they had capacity to monitor.<br><br> How could UXR help the company make sense of these ambient, user&#8209;generated feedback channels to guide human-centered design?
              </p>
              <h3>The Work</h3>
              <p class="summary-p">
                Over a year, I created a qual analysis platform linking feedback channels such as Zendesk support tickets to the Dovetail research app. With collaboration from Engineering and Customer Success, data automatically piped into Dovetail to be analyzed for feature requests, feedback, and more.
                  
                  <br><br>
                  I led the Insights team in developing a robust tagging taxonomy across both B2C and B2B carpooling segments for trackable and scalable insights.
              </p>

              <h3>The Impact</h3>
              <p class="summary-p">
                After implementation, the UXR team delivered monthly reports on user feedback to Product teams and in company&#8209;wide emails. 
                  <br><br>
                  Insights from these reports led to at least two features and several quality&#8209;of&#8209;life UI improvements, while helping guide product roadmap.

                  <p>We had two months to deeply investigate how high schoolers (and their influencing adults) plan their futures. While keeping an eye out for high-demand career selection, we were inductively looking to see what needs and problems arose.</p>

                <p>Our first research project was to get familiar with the ecosystem of career planning in middle and high school. In a literature review we looked at education policy, career social psychology, and multi-cultural considerations that reflect Pittsburghs' demographics.</p>
                <p>Remote interviews were then a quick and cost-effective way to probe a wide variety of first-hand experiences. We did 15 interviews across guidance counselors, parents, teachers, policy experts, non-profits, and students. Our topics included behavior related to career planning and advising, especially pain points and obstacles people faced.</p>

                  <p>Realizing that early high school students were our most promising target for an intervention, we needed a deeper dive into how a diverse array of high schoolers thought of their career futures and their challenges. We interviewed 12 more high schoolers, trying to get a mix of public and private schools in the city and more rural areas.</p>
                  <p>We were interested in a diversity of teens' internal experiences while planning career futures. Interviews probed on topics of their current career and post-high school plans, what in their past influenced them, interactions with adults/schools, and uncertainties they see in their future.</p>
                  <p>From these interviews, we clustered interview quotes into two levels of insights with an affinity diagram. Affinity diagraming helped the large research team synthesize takeaways and reach group understanding faster than a traditional coding process.</p>

What didn’t? We interviewed eight Pittsburgh-area adults (half in high-demand careers), taking notes in journey format for speedy synthesis.</p>
                    <p>The interviews were boiled down to three journies of job exploration. Those who found careers early, those that found one after some trial and error, and those that had not found a satisfying career yet.</p>

<!--                  <p>Of course high schoolers can’t predict their future careers, almost everyone pivots and explores. But by redirecting earlier towards interests, they can more easily pivot before it becomes costly.</p>-->

                <div class="medium-5 columns">
                  <p>Hoping to gain more context on Pittsburgh area high schoolers in person, we worked on getting into a high school for about two months.</p>
                    <p>We finally partnered with Elizabeth Forward High School, in a somewhat rural suburb. We negotiated working with four classrooms of early high schoolers, as well as a downtime to do contextual inquiries with teachers and guidance counselors.</p>
                    <p>To make the most of the 60+ students we were working with, we turned to codesign workshop activities. The first workshop in each group was research-oriented, quickly gathering info about student goals, planning behavior, and influences. The second workshop brought teens together to collaborate on solutions to career planning problems, using  provided materials. We wanted to see what teens felt was difficult and what solutions they were drawn to.</p>
                  <p>These workshops accomplished multiple things: gaining school context, gathering a wider sample of career prep behavior, and seeing what solutions teens created themselves.

                    <p>An important aspect of design research is sometimes investigating what your internal stakeholders believe and gravitate towards (with a grain of salt of course). Allegheny Conference had experts in economic development while numo had experts in interaction design.</p>
                    <p>We picked their brains through the codesign activity “Business Origami” from Bruce Hanington’s 100 Methods of Design. After small group brainstorming around design opportunities, they then brought ideas to life with cutouts of people, places, and devices. This forces design ideas to be dynamic and take into account social complexities of implementation.</p>
                    <p>This workshop not only helped provide one of our final design ideas, but gave us an understanding of sometimes conflicting client visions of the problems and what types of solutions they were willing to support.</p>
