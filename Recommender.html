				<h2>Objective</h2>
				<p>The MINI Recommender Tool is a web experience on MINIUSA.com designed to help early-stage car shoppers discover which MINI model and build is right for them. It consists of two series of questions, each outputting three suggested car models and accessory builds.</p>

				<p>At this stage of the design process, our research goal was to test the language, clarity of questions, input logic, and usability of high-fidelity wireframes. Suggestions were provided on how to improve the experience so that the UX Design team could solidify question logic before it was encoded in the development phase.</p>

				<h2>Process</h2>

				<p>Paper prototypes for both desktop and mobile experiences were printed out for testing. Our testing room included an over-the-shoulder camera to capture participants’ body language as well as their basic interactions with the active paper prototype. 8 participants were recruited across our key age ranges with balanced gender distribution. Both mobile and desktop wireframes were printed to scale and alternated between participants.</p>

				<p>Our testing was mostly qualitative - evaluating how users were perceiving the recommendation tool through observation and conversation. We wanted to really see if questions were clear and logically answered through the UI, as well as if the experience overall was meeting the needs of potential car owners. We randomly A/B tested different forms of input and phrasing for a few of the questions. Our testing mostly consisted of asking participants how they would answer questions while probing on clarity, expected outcomes, and relevance of the questions to their car search.</p>

				<p>Basic usability tests, such as if most participants clicked where we expected or could notice actions to take, were observed and coded into basic usability counts of success/failure. A more detailed late-stage usability test was planned for post-development.</p>

				<h2>My Role</h2>
				<p>I primarily transcribed detailed notes of the testing and traded off coding the usability section. I also moderated one of the eight tests and prepared testing matierials and room set-up. We collaboratively discussed trends and recommendations, and Krista and I drafted the recommendation readout for the Creative department.</p>

				<h2>Results</h2>
				<p>Our research identified several confusing areas of the question flow and provided recommendations for the A/B tests. Many of the questions included confusing colloquial language (especially for ESL speakers), while other questions frustrated shoppers because they were unclear on how their answer would influence car results.</p>

				<p>We discovered that reception to the Recommender also varied by how hands-on and “techy” a car buyer was. Techy and highly-targeted shoppers were frustrated by the constraints of the quiz and wanted to input their exact specifications, while more general shoppers found the quiz much more useful and enjoyable for learning about car options.</p>

				<h2>Takeaway</h2>
				<p>This experience taught me strategies for evaluating projects at mid-stage of creation, where we had the chance to redirect design before it was encoded by developers. Although it was mostly qualitative research on logic flow and clarity, the test’s blend of usability evaluation was new ground for me. In term of testing medium, the paper prototypes limited our ability to more thoroughly evaluate usability than a clickable or coded prototype. However, based on our time crunch and prioritizations of question logic as our research topic, the paper prototypes got the job done for evaluating effectiveness and clarity of quiz logic. The project was a rewarding mix of very targeted feedback on specific questions and inputs, while also looking at the big picture of which user demographics were benefiting most from the current Recommender Tool.</p>
